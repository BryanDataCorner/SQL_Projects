# Project Information

## Description
My project was based on a dataset that provides information about global confirmed COVID 19 deaths. 

## Date Range
The data in this dataset was collected from January 8, 2020 to March 7, 2023. The dataset was downloaded on March 8, 2023, and therefore does not include any data after that date.

## Source
The data was collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

## Data Format
The dataset is provided in CSV, XSLX, and JSON. The data is organized into one table with 67 columns and 293,434 rows.

## Data Preparation
After downloading the dataset, I separated it into two separate files: one for COVID-19 deaths and one for COVID-19 vaccinations. This was simply to make it easier for me to work with and to demonstrate my ability to use joins in SQL queries. You can download the files I used in my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hc-GoS5zeI57q_49pmjo_-2ABEnDkCfB?usp=sharing)
